        <p>
          <strong>Trust Bonds</strong> is a public good initiative created by
          former Kernel Block 9 participants, introducing a novel approach to
          establishing and verifying trust in monetary bonds between individuals
          within the Web3 environment. This incentivizes coordination, allowing
          participants to earn a higher-than-market-average yield on their
          savings, creating a new primitive for social reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those unfamiliar with the term,
          <strong>public goods</strong> are Web3 resources or services that are
          accessible to everyone in a non-excludable and non-rivalrous way. That
          is, one person's use of a public good doesn't reduce the availability
          to others, nor can anyone be prevented from using it. In the real
          world, examples include public parks or access to clean air. In Web3,
          public goods are projects that benefit the entire ecosystem, aiming to
          aid the growth of decentralized technologies and their popularity.

        <h2>Our Solutions</h2>
        <p>For this project, two Web3 solutions are being used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Aave</strong>: An open-source protocol used to create
            non-custodial liquidity markets to earn interest on supplying and
            borrowing assets with a variable interest rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gitcoin Passport</strong>: Provides an identity verification
            application and Sybil resistance protocol by aggregating various
            identity attributes such as social media verification or financial
            history. This creates a "digital passport" that can be used to
            participate in the application while reducing the risk of fake or
            duplicated identitiesâ€”known as Sybil attacks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How Trust Bonds Work</h2>
        <p>
          The project creates <strong>Trust Bonds</strong>, which are monetary
          bonds between two or more people who trust each other. Every
          participant contributes an equal amount of money to a shared account,
          and each of them has access to the total amount and can withdraw it at
          any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This works towards building trust and transparency in decentralized
          systems using these cutting-edge tools and helps users build on-chain
          reputation through their digital history and behavior recorded and
          verified on a blockchain. As all blockchain actions are transparent
          and immutable, users' interactions, contributions, and behavior with
          decentralized protocols will build up their reputation, allowing
          communities to assess trustworthiness without relying on traditional
          centralized institutions or other third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          Considering that when you form a Trust Bond with someone, you are also
          trusting them with a set amount of money, one can form different bonds
          of different values according to how much one trusts someone.
        </p>

        <h3>Bond Termination</h3>
        <p>The Bonds might end in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If all the participants mutually agree, bonds can be dissolved, and
            each person will receive the same amount of money (minus a 1%
            withdrawal fee).
          </li>
          <li>
            If a bad actor breaks the Trust Bond and takes all the money (minus
            a 4% withdrawal fee), thus breaking the trust of the other members
            of the bond.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="community">
        <h2>Incentivizing Coordination</h2>
        <p>
          The platform also incentivizes coordination through increased rewards
          with every additional person added to a Trust Bond. Since more people
          added to a Trust Bond also mean a higher risk of a "bad actor"
          breaking the bond, more coordination also means higher rewards.
        </p>

        <h2>Community Pool</h2>
        <p>
          Additionally, the Trust Bonds community has a
          <strong>Community Pool</strong> that holds the Community Funds,
          originating from donations, grants, and withdrawal fees mentioned
          before. These funds are also earned from yield from an Aave liquidity
          pool and are routinely distributed to the active community in the form
          of <strong>Community Reward Points (CRP)</strong>.
