# Trust Bonds

Read more on our [public website](https://leomoura.org/trust-bonds).

### Important parts

- `/packages/contracts`: all contracts and tests (`@trust-bonds/contracts`)
- `/docs/index.html`: the public website for the project

### Apps and Packages

These are stubs that will be useful in the future when we develop a dApp.

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- `ui`: a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

### In progress

We are currently working on launching a test contract on testnet.
